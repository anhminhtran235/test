            <h1>About the Collective</h1>
            <p>
              World Peace is a loose and informal collective of like-minded
              creatives from all across the globe with the common goal of
              producing and sharing art with a wider audience.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Defined by our lack of resources, funding, and even experience; we
              instead seek to create our own connections through the expansion
              of the collective, creating and maintaining a close-knit community
              of creatives in the process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rejecting irony in favour of sincerity, our interviews aim to
              provide a raw, unfiltered, and intimate dialogue between artist
              and audience.
