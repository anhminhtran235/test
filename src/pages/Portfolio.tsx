          Welcome to the secret section of my website. In case the giant
          “Portfolio” at the top of the page didn’t give it away, this is a
          showcase of most of my work with some added commentary so you can get
          the gist of my creative process. Everything on the site (graphics,
          interviews, text, etc.) is designed and created wholly by me, Rady
          Marcel Madkour, under the alias of ‘Neohippy’, unless otherwise
          stated. You can return to the main site by clicking{' '}

          I made these fake Wealthsimple ads for a course back in the fall of
          2021. The project was pretty straightforward; make an ad campaign for
          a company related to disruptive technology. I picked Wealthsimple
          since I was a fan of the platform itself as well as their ads,
          especially the Half a Million Mikes video ad. I noticed that
          Wealthsimple used a muted color palette for pretty much all their ads
          so I decided to emulate the artstyle and combine it with some, at
          least in my opinion, witty copy. I had too much fun thinking of
          potential copy for these ads, just trying to find the wittiest and
          most creative way of showing off Wealthsimple’s features. By the end
          of it I couldn’t help but think “Man, imagine these on a 40-foot tall
          billboard”. I guess these were some quality ads since I got a 90% for
          the project, not to brag or anything. (Nov. 2021)

              Probably one of my favourite ads solely in terms of composition
              and aesthetics. This project came about after a serious creative
              slump, and after finding some inspiration on Twitter I decided to
              undertake the task of creating a vintage magazine ad. Why New
              Balance? I can’t tell you for sure. Maybe it’s the company’s
              resurgence, or maybe their frequent collaborations with New
              York-based fashion house Aimé Leon Dore; either way I just thought
              that a New Balance shoe would be the perfect fit for an ad that
              looked like it was plucked straight out of the 90’s. I mean, the
              ad looks like something out of Seinfeld’s mise en scene. So I
              settled on the 574v3 because I loved its silhouette.

              <br></br>
              Since I didn’t have access to a scanner at the time of making the
              ad, I decided to make my own grain to give it that salvaged and
              vintage feel. I also used an asset of a scanned in blank page and
              blended it on the top layer of the image so that I could achieve
              those scratches and dirt specs. Admittedly, the copy is a bit
              weak. “The Perfect Sneaker”, no self-respecting sneaker ad would
              ever say that. But again, I just focused on composition. (Feb.

              I woke up to a text from a friend one day that read “Bro, wanna
              make a cover some of my throaway beats? I’m close to selling it to
              someone for 120$. I’ll give you half.”
            </p>
            <p>
              <br></br>I said yes instantly, I don’t know what made me happier:
              the fact that he was asking me to design an album cover for him or
              the promise of money. Regardless, I made a cup of coffee and
              started working on some concepts. Originally I planned to design a
              fake shipping label with the artist and album name on it and call
              it a day, but I thought that would be way too half-assed. So after
              some research and a bit of music I began to brainstorm what I
              could stick the fake shipping label on. A cardboard box? A jewel
              case like the Yeezus cover? Nah, how about one of those metallic
              bags that dispensaries give you? Hell yeah.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br></br>
              So I started off by designing a custom typface on Adobe
              Illustrator. I wanted to go for a subdued and subtle Y2K
              direction, because I didn’t know what type of beats were going to
              be on the album and I didn’t want an aesthetic clash. The typeface
              turned out great and so I decided to use it for the artist name;
              Lapse. As for the fake shipping labels and stickers, they were fun
              to make. Trying to make the typeface and graphics seem like they
              were printed onto the stickers was immensely satisfying; I used a
              bunch of different effects on Photoshop to get that ink bleed and
              worn out effect. Of course I couldn’t help but put a not-so-
              subtle shoutout to World Peace Collective in the form of that
              conspicuous red sticker.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br></br>
              Lapse and I maintained contact throughout the day as I worked on
              cover, showing him my progress and following his feedback. By the
              end of the day I presented Lapse with the finished cover and we
              both liked the end result. I threw in an alternate cover in silver
              just in case he wanted something a little different.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br></br>
              Oh and the sale never went through. Still waiting on that 60$ bro.

              This ad make me wants to chef kiss the air and start sweet talking
              my computer screen. Because god damn, this is without a doubt my
              favourite project.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br></br>So, as you know, World Peace Collective is a passion
              project that I spearheaded, and as I was designing the layouts for
              the website I began to notice we lacked a “hearth”. That is to say
              a central monument that represented the collective as a whole, an
              artifact that people would look at and associate with us. This
              deeply troubled me, although I wanted the site to be a blank slate
              as to not clash with the creatives’ disparate styles, we still
              needed a banner to rally under. So I decided to do something I
              knew I was good at; making ads.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br></br>
              Yeah, I might’ve rehashed the vintage magazine ad idea but this
              felt especially fitting. Something about the grain, scratches,
              scan marks, and imperfections not only signifies a bygone era that
              we look back on and remember fondly--whether or not we were
              present--but it also reflected the collective. I kept the copy as
              simple as possible. “Terminally Online.” Who or what’s terminally
              online? The website? Me? The collective? The reader? It doesn’t
              matter. As long as there’s an internet connection, World Peace
              Collective continues to live and breathe.
            </p>
            <p>
              <br></br>
              As for the technical aspects of the ad, I just took a picture of
              my Macbook with my phone and fixed the lighting and shadows on
              photoshop, added a blue glow to the screen and of course the World
              Peace sigil. I also added a CRTscreen effect on the laptop just to
              add to the anachronistic 90’s verisimilitude.

              <br></br>I added this image to the About page of the site as I

              I do. (Mar. 2022)
