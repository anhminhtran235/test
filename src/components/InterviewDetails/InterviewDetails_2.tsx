            “I know a lot of people from my background haven’t made it, I just
            want to be the first one to do it.“

            Toronto-based producer Lapse’s background is as eclectic as his body
            of work; spanning several different genres, and constantly moving
            from region to region. The musical vagabond opens up about his
            history and future ambitions, seeking to perfect his craft and make
            a name for himself. You can listen to his new track here.

            ques='First off, I’d like to thank you for agreeing to do this interview with me.'
            ans='No probs, man.'
          />
          <QuesAns
            ques='So, introduce yourself. What’s your name? What do people refer to you as? What do you do?'
            ans='My name’s Mohit, I go by the name of Lapse. That’s my artist name. I was born and
            raised in the UAE, but I’m ethnically Indian. I moved to Vancouver for university, and I’m
            in Toronto now. Oh, and I’m a music producer.'
          />
          <QuesAns
            ques='You used to go by a couple of different artist names in the past, why’d you decide
            to switch it up?'
            ans='Because they just sounded really corny to me. Lapse is the only name that has any
            meaning behind it.'
          />
          <QuesAns
            ques='And was there a general change in the direction of your aesthetic as your artist
            name evolved?'
            ans='Yeah, definitely. My first artist name was Nergham when I was 14, it was some stupid
            gamer name that I used for League of Legends which eventually bled into my music, I
            don’t know why I chose that name. I was just learning at that point. Then I switched it to
            Sydyce in 2019, and I thought it sounded really corny after a while. It sounded like some
            EDM shit. So yeah, I chose Lapse because I felt like it’d age well. That’s why I picked it.'
          />
          <QuesAns
            ques='So, talk to me about your early life, the years that led up to where you are now.'
            ans='My parents raised me obviously, I have an older sister. She used to listen to a lot of pop
            music when I was a kid, so that was the only shit I was exposed to, that’s what I thought
            music was. It sounded really cringe to me, you know, Miley Cyrus, and other pop artists.
            I understand why it was popular back then, but at the time I thought that was what music
            as a whole was and I just thought it was really whack.'
          />
          <QuesAns
            ques='That sounds like an unlikely start to your career as a music producer.'
            ans='Well eventually I started listening to hip hop, like 50 Cent and the whole G-Unit thing, and
            old Eminem like Slim Shady when I was like nine or ten, that’s when I realized there were
            more genres to music than just mainstream pop.'
          />
          <QuesAns
            ques='And how’d you get into producing?'
            ans='I was like a soccer guy back then, I wasn’t really into music like that. I ended up getting
            an ACL injury in the 10th grade, so that gave me hella free time, and obviously I hated
            studying, so I wanted to find something else to occupy my time. So yeah, music.'

          <ImgComponent src='/Interview_artist_web_resources/IMG_8937.jpg' />
          <QuesAns
            ques='So you picked up music as a way to stave off the boredom while you were recovering?'
            ans='Pretty much, yeah. I was like “fuck soccer”, it was too much, and I just stuck to music.'
          />
          <QuesAns
            ques='And do you think growing up in the UAE influenced your music taste and the
            trajectory of your production?'
            ans='Oh yeah. Because there’s no music culture in Dubai. People only go there to make
            money, there’s no real music culture basically. So everyone listens to completely different
            shit, so I didn’t know what was popular and what wasn’t. I was just listening to random
            tracks that I downloaded off of websites. They were mostly rap tunes, but some of my
            friends showed me some other tracks. That was kinda like my first dive into music.'
          />
          <QuesAns
            ques='How do you think it changed when you came here to Canada? Especially switching
            between Vancouver and Toronto, do you think that also developed your taste and
            artistic direction?'
            ans='Not really, actually. Ever since I moved here to Toronto I haven’t been hanging out with
            people as much, because I guess I’m more introverted now. But I’ve been listening to
            more music that I actually like and I don’t have to give a shit about what others like,
            we’re not listening together, it’s just me in my room so I discovered some new and weird
            genres.'
          />
          <QuesAns
            ques='Talk to me about your creative process and some of your artistic influences.'
            ans='My influences keep changing. I get bored really quickly, the shit I used to listen to six
            months ago, I just look back and think “I don’t wanna listen to this right now”. But I’d say
            one of my current influences is JPEGMAFIA. He’s a rapper and producer from Baltimore,
            he’s pretty cool. He’s weird, he’s just being himself, that’s what I like about him. Slowthai
            too, he’s a really good rapper and he knows how to pick good beats. He’s also really
            unique, there’s only one Slowthai, he’s not some generic rapper.'
          />
          <QuesAns
            ques='And you mentioned during our conversations that Flume was one of your major
            influences back then.'
            ans='Oh yeah, for sure. Before Flume, I only used to listen to hip hop and shit. Then I
            listened to his Skin album around 2016 and thought “Yo, this is sick”. It was like a good
            introduction to literally every other genre that I listen to now, especially IDM.'
          />
          <QuesAns
            ques='So it’s safe to say that Flume made you appreciate music in a wider context.'
            ans='Yeah.'
          />
          <ImgComponent src='/Interview_artist_web_resources/IMG_8982.jpg' />
          <QuesAns
            ques='Are there any upcoming projects that you’re working on? Because you’ve only released
            singles thus far, are you working towards a more cohesive full-length album
            or EP?'
            ans='I’ve been dropping music since I was 17-18, that’s literally when I started making music.
            But I’ve actually been making music since I was 16 and never told anyone. Wait, what
            was the question again? [laughing]'
          />
          <QuesAns
            ques='Are you working on a cohesive full-length project?'
            ans='At certain points I’m really interested in one sound a synthesizer makes, or I find a bunch
            of effects that I think makes for a unique sound for myself. So without knowing it, I just
            started using those sounds and they sound good in different contexts. When you put
            them all together, it feels like one cohesive thing. But I don’t think I’m going to release an
            EP just like that, at first I want to drop a few singles here and there and maybe later I’ll
            drop a full length project.'
          />
          <QuesAns
            ques='Why didn’t you share your music during your first two years of producing?'
            ans='It’s just the people I used to see around me. They were really whack, I used to make fun
            of them. It’s just these rappers and producers, they just wanted to do it because it was
            cool. It just looked funny as shit, so I didn’t wanna end up being like that. If I want to
            show my music to someone, it has to be really good, and once it’s really good I’ll show it
            off like “Yo, this is my shit man”.'
          />
          <QuesAns
            ques='So I guess you’re a perfectionist in a sense. You don’t want to release music that’s
            not up to your standards.'
            ans='Yeah.'
          />
          <QuesAns
            ques='And I’m assuming it’s especially difficult because you’re constantly experimenting
            with your style and using sounds in different contexts. I remember you sent me one
            of your tracks, it had this avant-garde jazz sax sample but the drums were almost
            IDM-like.'
            ans='I fell into this Spotify rabbithole and just discovered a bunch of artists that I ended up
            liking and kept replaying their songs. I listened to every one of Floating Points albums
            and liked his jazz influence, and I was kinda inspired by that which led to the creation of
            that track. I don’t think I’m gonna make that my thing, I was just experimenting. It keeps
            changing. I make literally everything. I started off with dubstep. I hate dubstep now, but
            the one good thing about it is that I personally feel like it’s one of the hardest genres
            to make, because the technical skills you need for that like sound design and mixing &
            mastering are required just to make it sound half decent. You need to know your shit.'

          />
          <QuesAns
            ques='So you changed genres multiple times, how would you describe your current
            sound?'
            ans='Like, really underground obscure shit. Electronica, I’d say. But I do mainstream shit too,
            shit inspired by Charli XCX and the whole PC Music collective stuff. I like to combine
            obscure stuff and pop music and turn it into something more digestible. Like how Kanye
            West produces his stuff, he’s got really obscure influences but he’s a mainstream artist.
            He knows how to have experimental elements present in his music but still maintain the
            pop and mainstream appeal.'
          />
          <QuesAns
            ques='We both usually get frustrated with our creative work when things aren’t going as
            smoothly as planned, and we fall into a slump as a result. How do you get around
            that so that you can create more music?'
            ans='I don’t think it happens to me anymore, to be honest. It used to happen before, because
            I was still learning everything on Ableton. If I wanted to do something and didn’t know
            how to do it, I had to watch some tutorial on Youtube or something. But now it’s just like
            second nature to me, I know what to do. Whatever’s in my head I can translate that into
            Ableton.'
          />
          <QuesAns
            ques='When it comes to collaboration with other artists, do you feel like you work better
            with them or do you prefer to work alone where you have more control over your
            sound?'
            ans='Everytime I try to bring in an artist it always turns into something else, it’s not a studio
            session anymore. Most of the fucking people I bring in, they just do drugs. I don’t like that
            when we’re making music. In their head they think it’s dope, but it just ends up sounding
            like shit most of the time. I’m really picky with the artists I choose to work with. At the
            moment I like working with myself, but I want to change that. If I need to make a good
            record, I know I need to bring in an artist that’s comfortable working with a producer.'
          />
          <QuesAns
            ques='As a producer in Canada, would you even describe yourself as a Canadian
            musician? Do you draw a line when it comes to regions, or do you consider yourself
            a global artist?'
            ans='I’m definitely an online global artist. Even though I stay here and have been here for a
            long time, I wouldn’t call myself a Canadian producer. I represent the international student
            community in this country. I know a lot of people from my background haven’t made it, I
            just want to be the first one to do it.'
          />
          <QuesAns
            ques='What do you think of the influx of young producers trying to make it big? Like, they
            pick up FL Studio and try to make whatever music and maybe gain some clout and
            a bit of fame.'
            ans='They wanna make their own shit. Like everyone else, they wanna make music. It’s kind
            of a personal thing, at least for me, music is really personal. It’s like someone opening up
            your personal diary and reading your shit out loud. The thing is, a lot of artists wanna do
            it so they look cool, that’s how I started as well, but the ones who keep going at it and
            genuinely want to do something with their music or bring something new to the table, I
            respect those people. But for the rest of them, if you really wanna do it just then just do it.'

          <QuesAns
            ques='You’ve gained a lot of experience in the past couple of years of producing, do you
            have any words of advice for young and upcoming producers?'
            ans='My advice is not to take advice [laughing]. The way you learn is different for everyone. I
            learned production in the most nerdy way possible, I read the entirety of the Ableton and
            Serum manuals. It was really boring but I was desperate to learn, because the Youtube
            tutorials were shit at the time. I just started practicing and experimenting from there.'

          <QuesAns
            ques='Do you have anything you want to say to the world?'
            ans='Yeah. I don’t know how long it’s going to take me, but you’ll see me soon. I’m still building
            my stuff. I’ve got some life shit going on, but once I fix that I’m going to launch my career.'
