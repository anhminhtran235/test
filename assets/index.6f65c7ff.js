The typeface turned out great and so I decided to use it for the artist name; Lapse. As for the fake shipping labels and stickers, they were fun to make. Trying to make the typeface and graphics seem like they were printed onto the stickers was immensely satisfying; I used a bunch of different effects on Photoshop to get that ink bleed and worn out effect.

Most of the fucking people I bring in, they just do drugs. I don\u2019t like that\r when we\u2019re making music. In their head they think it\u2019s dope, but it just ends up sounding\r like shit most of the time. I\u2019m really picky with the artists I choose to work with.

If I need to make a good\r record, I know I need to bring in an artist that\u2019s comfortable working with a producer."}),e(t,{ques:"As a producer in Canada, would you even describe yourself as a Canadian\r musician? Do you draw a line when it comes to regions, or do you consider yourself\r a global artist?",ans:"I\u2019m definitely an online global artist. Even though I stay here and have been here for a\r long time, I wouldn\u2019t call myself a Canadian producer. I represent the international student\r community in this country.

It\u2019s kind\r of a personal thing, at least for me, music is really personal. It\u2019s like someone opening up\r your personal diary and reading your shit out loud. The thing is, a lot of artists wanna do\r it so they look cool, that\u2019s how I started as well, but the ones who keep going at it and\r genuinely want to do something with their music or bring something new to the table, I\r respect those people.
